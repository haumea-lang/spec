# Comments
Haumea currently has just one kind of comment, **block comments**. You may write them by placing your comment in between `/*` and `*/`, `/* like so */`. You can also nest them:

```
/* This is
/* my nested
/* comment */
that is */
cool */
```

Comments are completely ignored, so you can write whatever you want in them.
